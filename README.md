# Mobile Flashcards Project

A Redux/ReactNative mobile application (for Android and iOS) that allows users to create different categories of flashcards called "decks", add flashcards to those decks, then take quizzes on those decks. No starter code was provided. The project emphasizes using React Native and Redux to build an iOS and Android native application, including handling infinite lists, routing, and user input.

## Data
AsyncStorage is used to store decks and flashcards locally.

```{
  React: {
    title: 'React',
    questions: [
      {
        question: 'What is React?',
        answer: 'A library for managing user interfaces'
      },
      {
        question: 'Where do you make Ajax requests in React?',
        answer: 'The componentDidMount lifecycle event'
      }
    ]
  },
  JavaScript: {
    title: 'JavaScript',
    questions: [
      {
        question: 'What is a closure?',
        answer: 'The combination of a function and the lexical environment within which that function was declared.'
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## API

Helper methods used to manage AsyncStorage database
- `getDecks`: return all of the decks along with their titles, questions, and answers. 
- `getDeck`: take in a single `id` argument and return the deck associated with that id. 
- `saveDeckTitle`: take in a single `title` argument and add it to the decks. 
- `addCardToDeck`: take in two arguments, `title` and `card`, and will add the card to the list of questions for the deck with the associated title.
